A digital clock shell script is a script written in a shell scripting language (such as Bash) that displays the current time in a digital format on the command line interface or terminal. It typically retrieves the current system time using system commands or utilities, formats it to display hours, minutes, and seconds, and continuously updates the display to reflect the current time. This type of script can be useful for displaying the time in a simple and easily accessible manner within a terminal environment, without the need for graphical interfaces.
